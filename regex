REGULAR EXPRESSION 

# test regular expression with test()
myString = ''
myRegex = //
myRegex.test(myString)

# regex is case sensitive 
if 
myString="happy dog"
myRegex=/Happy/
myRegex test (myString) = false, unless changed to "Happy dog", or with ignore case //i
syntax: /Happy/i can make myString = true 

# matching with multiple possibilities with |
myRegex = /a|b|c/

# exact match with match()
similar function to test() except for order 
myString.match(/hallo/ or myRegex)
