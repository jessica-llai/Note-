#declarration with let/ var 
if a function/if contain i that has appeared before, should declared again 


# mutable array 
the array declared by const is not mutable by assigning s=[]again
but can do so by changing each specific element s[0]=1

# prevent mutation in the array with Object.freeze()
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);

# concise way of writing functions 
//not to use var 
const function1 = function() {} -> const function1 = () => {}
const mutiplier = (a,b)=>(a*b)
const multiplier(2,5)= 10

# setting defualt parameter 
const increment = (number, value=1) => number + value;
the value = 1 is set to prevent undefied value induced errors
